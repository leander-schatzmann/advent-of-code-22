# My advent of code contributions for the year 2022

From Advent of Code Website: 
## "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.", 
also: "Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't full yet and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is full. 
## If you are unlikely to get points or the daily leaderboard is already full for the puzzle you're working on, streaming is fine."
